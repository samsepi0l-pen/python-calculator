# Interest calculator
---->This is an interest calculator using python programming language.
---->This program only uses a loop i.e, while loop.
---->It first asks user for the Principle amount , Interest rate and Time in years.
---->It then checks if the user entered zero or less than zero value in those three input fields.
---->If the user enters zero or negative number it uses while loop and prompts the user to again enter the correct number infinite times.
---->Now if the user enters a correct number for those three fields it uses a formula to calculate the profit i.e, 
A = P(1+ R / 100)^T
where,
A = Profit
P = Principle amount
R = Interest rate
T = Time
---->It finally prints the profit amount.
