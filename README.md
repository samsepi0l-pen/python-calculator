# python calculator
This is a simple python calculator using if , else , elif statements

--->It first takes the wanted operator from user i.e, from (+,-,*,/).

--->It next takes two floating point numbers from user they are assigned to two variables called num1 , num2.

--->Then uses the first if statement to see whether the user entered "+" operator , if the user enters that operator the num1 and num2 are added and then returns the value after adding.

--->Then uses the first elif statement to see whether the user entered "-" operator , if the user enters that operator the num1 and num2 are subtracted and then returns the value after subtracting.

--->Then uses the second elif statement to see whether the user entered "*" operator , if the user enters that operator the num1 and num2 are multiplicated and then returns the value after multiplicating.

--->Then uses the third elif statement to see whether the user entered "/" operator , if the user enters that operator the num1 and num2 are divided and then returns the value after dividing.

--->Finally there will be an else statement , it checks the operator entered by user if the user entered an operator outside (+,-,*,/) it returns a print statement that basically says "the operator entered is invalid".
